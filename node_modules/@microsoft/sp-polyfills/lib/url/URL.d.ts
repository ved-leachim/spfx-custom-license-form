/**
 * This is an incomplete implementation of a URL polyfill. These things are not supported, or not fully supported:
 *  - baseURLString constructor property
 *      This means that `new URL('http://contoso.com/path/to/something', 'http://fabrikam.com')` will not work,
 *        but the same thing can be accomplished with:
 *      const url = new new URL('http://contoso.com/path/to/something');
 *      url.host = 'fabrikam.com';
 *
 *  - Username
 *      The username property is not supported and will always return the empty string. Setting the username has
 *        no effect.
 *
 *  - Password
 *      The password property is not supported and will always return the empty string. Setting the password has
 *        no effect.
 *
 *  - Setting the pathname property with a value containing encoded values will double-encode the encoded values.
 *      For example. myUrl.pathname = "path%2Bto/resource.json" => myUrl.pathname === "/path%252Bto/resource.json"
 *      To set the pathname to a value that contains a special character, set it with the un-encoded character.
 *      The encoded "/" character (%2F) is not supported
