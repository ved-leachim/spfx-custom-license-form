     * This number represents how far away this Task is from the furthest "root" project (i.e.

     * longest chain of projects which must be executed in order, thereby limiting execution speed
     * of the entire task tree.
     *
     * This number is calculated via a memoized recursive function, and when choosing the next
     * task to execute, the task with the highest criticalPathLength is chosen.
     *
     * Example:
     *        (0) A
     *             \
     *          (1) B     C (0)         (applications)
     *               \   /|\
     *                \ / | \
     *             (2) D  |  X (1)      (utilities)
     *                    | / \
     *                    |/   \
     *                (2) Y     Z (2)   (other utilities)
     *
     * All roots (A & C) have a criticalPathLength of 0.
     * B has a score of 1, since A depends on it.
     * D has a score of 2, since we look at the longest chain (e.g D->B->A is longer than D->C)
     * X has a score of 1, since the only package which depends on it is A
     * Z has a score of 2, since only X depends on it, and X has a score of 1
     * Y has a score of 2, since the chain Y->X->C is longer than Y->C
     *
     * The algorithm is implemented in TaskRunner as _calculateCriticalPaths()
