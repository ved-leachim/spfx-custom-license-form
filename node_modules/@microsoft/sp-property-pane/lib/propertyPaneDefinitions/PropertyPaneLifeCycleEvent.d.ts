/**
 * Object representing the property pane life cycle events.
 *
 * `ConfigurationStart` Event indicating the start of the component's configuration in the PropertyPane.
 *
 * This event is triggered in the following scenarios:
 *  - After user clicks on 'configure' button or
 *  - After user invokes 'openPropertyPane' or 'refreshPropertyPane' from a component or
 *  - When the user switches components and the new component will get the event.
 *
 * `ConfigurationComplete` Event indicating that the component's configuration is complete in the PropertyPane.
 *
 * This event is triggered in the following scenarios:
 *  - When the CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE_TIMEOUT(currently the value is 5 secs) elapses after the last change and
 *    the PropertyPane is still in focus.
 *  - If the PropertyPane is closed, before the CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE_TIMEOUT elapses.
 *      In this case 'ConfigurationComplete' is fired before the 'Closed' is fired.
 *  - If the ApplyClicked event is triggered, before the CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE_TIMEOUT elapses.
 *  - When the user switches components and the current component will get the event.
 *
 * `Opened` Event indicating that the PropertyPane is opened.
 *
 * This event is triggered after the PropertyPane opens(slides in). This happens in the following cases:
 *  - When the user tries to configure using the 'configure' button or calling openPropertyPane or
 *    refreshPropertyPane from the component
 *    while the PropertyPane is closed.
 * This event is fired before the 'ConfigurationStart' event is fired.
 *
 * `Closed` Event indicating that the PropertyPane is closed.
 *
 * This event is triggered after the PropertyPane is closed(slides out). This happens in two cases:
 *  - When user clicks 'x' button on the PropertyPane.
 *  - When user toggles the already open PropertyPane.
 *
 * `ApplyClicked` Event indicating that the 'Apply' button is clicked on the PropertyPane.
 *
 * This event is triggered only on the non-reactive PropertyPane.
 *
 * `LostFocus` Event indicating that the PropertyPane lost the focus.
 *
 * This event is triggered when 'Alt + P'(this is the key combination to toggle the property pane focus)
 * is pressed while the PropertyPane is in focus. This results in PropertyPane loosing the focus and
 * it's associated component will get back the focus.
 *
 * `ActiveWebPartChanged` Event indicating that the active web part has changed.
 *
 * This event indicates either of the following two things:
 *  - A new component has requested to configure or
 *  - The current component has requested to open/toggle the property pane while it's closed.
